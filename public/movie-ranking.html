<h1>The Best Movies According to Sayo</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all Time</h2><hr/>
<H3>Friends.</H3>
<p>It is a sitcom about 6 Friends, It showed Growth of technolgy between 1994 and 2004(which means the movie <br/>spanded for 10 years), it showed how when we grow older we begin to drift away and focus more on ourselves, career, partner and future. </p>
<h3>Ibi Giga.</h3>
<p>It's a tragic about a poor man with a child and his wife who left him due to pressure from her family because the<br/> man is poor well yea it is a normal story line but it is the only movie that made Sayo cry so yea it deserves to be <br/>here.</p>
<h3>One indian movie(can't remember the name again).</h3>
<p> As you can see i can't remember the title of the movie but it is the only suspense movie i couldn't guess who the <br/>vilan was until the police man revealed it at the end of the Movie(sorry but no spoilers). </p>
